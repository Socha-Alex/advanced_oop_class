This repository contains the program I am writing with my partern in my Advanced C++ class at the Univeristy of New Haven

This program runs a board game called Can't Stop, which involves players moving colored colomuns along a tiled game board.
It involves the integration of multiple different classes for each element of the game and features exercises in inheritance,
polymorphism, abstract classes, and virtual functions.
